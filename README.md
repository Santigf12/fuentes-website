# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. The website is a portfolio showcasing my resume and projects. It is a single-page website with a splash page, resume page, and projects page.

I'm using the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). The theme is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. It is designed for simplicity and ease of use. It is responsive and mobile-friendly. It has a clean and minimal design. It is highly customizable and has many features.
